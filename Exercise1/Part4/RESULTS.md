**Results:**

*C:* 
Lots of weird numbers, postive and negative, sometimes zero

*Go:*
Lots of weird numbers,postive and negative, but a little more zeroes? (which is probably good)

*Python:*
Never zero. Always like 1 000 000 +


The threads aren't "synchronized"/this concurrency isn't a very good simulation of parallellism? So the threads sometimes increments/decrements more
